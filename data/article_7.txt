SECTION 62-7-201. Role of court in administration of trust.

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 62-1-302(d), the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings initiated by interested parties concerning the internal affairs of trusts. These proceedings must be formal as defined by Section 62-1-201(17) but consent petitions are not subject to the requirements of formal proceedings. Proceedings that may be maintained pursuant to this section are those concerning the administration and distribution of trusts, the declaration of rights, and the determination of other matters involving trustees and beneficiaries of trusts. These include, but are not limited to, proceedings to:

(1) ascertain beneficiaries, determine a question arising in the administration or distribution of a trust including questions of construction of trust instruments, instruct trustees, and determine the existence or nonexistence of any immunity, power, privilege, duty, or right;

The provisions of this section do not apply to the extent there is a contract providing for the compensation to be paid for the trustee's services or if the trust directs otherwise; and

(4) appoint or remove a trustee.

(b) A proceeding under this section does not result in continuing supervisory proceedings. The management and distribution of a trust estate, submission of accounts and reports to beneficiaries, payment of trustee's fees and other obligations of a trust, acceptance and change of trusteeship, and other aspects of the administration of a trust shall proceed expeditiously consistent with the terms of the trust, free of judicial intervention and without order, approval, or other action of any court, subject to the jurisdiction of the court as invoked by interested parties or as otherwise exercised as provided by law or by the terms of the trust.

(2) actions by or against creditors or debtors of trusts; and

(3) other actions and proceedings involving trustees and third parties.

(1) when all appropriate parties could not be bound by litigation in the courts of the state where the trust is registered or has its principal place of administration; or

(2) when the interests of justice otherwise would seriously be impaired.

The court may condition a stay or dismissal of a proceeding under this section on the consent of any party to jurisdiction of the state in which the trust is registered or has its principal place of business, or the court may grant a continuance or enter any other appropriate order.

(b) If a trust has no trustee, venue for a judicial proceeding for the appointment of a trustee is in a county in which any trust property is located or the county where the last trustee had its principal place of administration, and if the trust is created by will, in the county in which the decedent's estate was or is being administered.

(c) If proceedings concerning the same trust could be maintained in more than one place in South Carolina, the court in which the proceeding is first commenced has the exclusive right to proceed.

(d) If proceedings concerning the same trust are commenced in more than one court of South Carolina, the court in which the proceeding was first commenced shall continue to hear the matter, and the other courts shall hold the matter in abeyance until the question of venue is decided, and, if the ruling court determines that venue is properly in another court, it shall transfer the proceeding to the other court.

(e) If a court transfers venue of a proceeding concerning a trust to a court in another county, venue for that proceeding, and any subsequent matters concerning that proceeding, including appeals, shall be retained by the county to which the venue has been transferred.

Part 4

Creation, Validity, Modification, and Termination of Trusts

SECTION 62-7-401. Methods of creating trust.

(a)(1) A trust described in Section 62-7-102 may be created by:

(i) transfer of property to another person as trustee during the settlor's lifetime or by will or other disposition taking effect upon the settlor's death;

(ii) written declaration signed by the owner of property that the owner holds identifiable property as trustee; or

(iii) exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a trustee.

(2) To be valid, a trust of real property, created by transfer in trust or by declaration of trust, must be proved by some writing signed by the party creating the trust. A transfer in trust of personal property does not require written evidence, but must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to Section 62-7-407.

(b) A trust that arises by act or operation of law does not require the existence of a writing.

(c) A revocable inter vivos trust may be created either by declaration of trust or by a transfer of property and is not rendered invalid because the settler retains substantial control over the trust including, but not limited to, (i) a right of revocation, (ii) substantial beneficial interests in the trust, or (iii) the power to control investments or reinvestments. This subsection does not prevent a finding that a revocable inter vivos trust, enforceable for other purposes, is illusory for purposes of determining a spouse's elective share rights pursuant to Article 2, Title 62. A finding that a revocable inter vivos trust is illusory and thus invalid for purposes of determining a spouse's elective share rights pursuant to Article 2, Title 62 does not render that revocable inter vivos trust invalid, but allows inclusion of the trust assets as part of the probate estate of the settlor only for the purpose of calculating the elective share. In that event, the trust property that passes or has passed to the surviving spouse, including a beneficial interest of the surviving spouse in that trust property, must be applied first to satisfy the elective share and to reduce contributions due from other recipient of transfers including the probate estate, and the trust assets are available for satisfaction of the elective share only to any remaining extent necessary pursuant to Section 62-2-207.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 181, Section 2, eff May 28, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

Effect of Amendment

The 2010 amendment rewrote subsection (c) to include a surviving spouse's beneficial interests in trust property in calculating the elective share.

The 2013 amendment rewrote subsections (a) and (b).

SECTION 62-7-402. Requirements for creation; merger of title.

(a) A trust is created only if:

(1) the settlor has capacity to create a trust;

(2) the settlor indicates an intention to create the trust;

(3) the trust has a definite beneficiary or is:

(A) a charitable trust;

(B) a trust for the care of an animal, as provided in Section 62-7-408; or

(C) a trust for a noncharitable purpose, as provided in Section 62-7-409;

(4) the trustee has duties to perform; and

(5) the same person is not the sole trustee and sole current and future beneficiary.

(b) If the trust agreement is in writing, the trust instrument may be signed by the settlor or in the settlor's name by some other person in the settlor's presence and by the settlor's direction.

(c) A beneficiary is definite if the beneficiary can be ascertained now or in the future, subject to any applicable rule against perpetuities.

(d) A power in a trustee to select a beneficiary from an indefinite class is valid. If the power is not exercised within a reasonable time, the power fails and the property subject to the power passes to the persons who would have taken the property had the power not been conferred.

(e) For purposes of Section 62-7-402(a)(5), if a person holds legal title to property in a fiduciary capacity and also has an equitable or beneficial title in the same property, either by transfer, by declaration, or by operation of law, no merger of the legal and equitable titles shall occur unless:

(1) the fiduciary is the sole fiduciary and is also the sole current and future beneficiary; and

(2) the legal title and the equitable title are of the same quality and duration.

If either one of these conditions is not met, no merger may occur and the fiduciary relationship does not terminate.

(1) the settlor was domiciled, had a place of abode, or was a national;

(2) a trustee was domiciled or had a place of business; or

(d) Unless otherwise required by statute or by rule or regulation of the Attorney General, the trustees of charitable trusts shall not be required to file with the Attorney General any copies of trusts instruments or reports concerning the activities of charitable trusts.

(e) The Attorney General may make such rules and regulations relating to the information to be contained with the filing of a trust as may be required.

(f) All trustees of any trust governed by the laws of this State whose governing instrument does not expressly provide that this section shall not apply to such trust are required to act or to refrain from acting so as not to subject the trust to the taxes imposed by Sections 4941, 4942, 4943, 4944, or 4945 of the Internal Revenue Code, or corresponding provisions of any subsequent United States internal revenue law.

(g) Nothing contained in Sections 33-31-150 and 33-31-151 may be construed to cause a forfeiture or reversion of any of the property of a trust which is subject to such Sections, or to make the purposes of the trust impossible of accomplishment.

(1) a beneficiary who is a trustee of a trust, but who is not the settlor of the trust, cannot be treated in the same manner as the settlor of a revocable trust if the beneficiary-trustee's power to make distributions to the beneficiary-trustee is limited by an ascertainable standard related to the beneficiary-trustee's health, education, maintenance, and support;

(B) by oral statement to the trustee if the trust was created orally; or

SECTION 62-7-603. Settlor's powers.

While a trust is revocable, rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the control of, and the duties of the trustee are owed exclusively to, the settlor.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-604. Limitation on action contesting validity of revocable trust; distribution of trust property.

(a) A person must commence a judicial proceeding to contest the validity of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death within the earlier of:

(2) one hundred twenty days after the trustee sent the person a copy of the trust instrument and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's name and address, and of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding.

(b) Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless:

(1) the trustee knows of a pending judicial proceeding contesting the validity of the trust; or

(2) a potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible judicial proceeding to contest the trust and a judicial proceeding is commenced within one hundred twenty days after the contestant sent the notification.

(c) A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is liable to return any distribution received.

Effect of Amendment

The 2010 amendment in subsections (a)(2) and (b)(2) substituted "one hundred twenty" for "60" preceding "days after the".

SECTION 62-7-605. Effect of penalty clause for contest.

A provision in a revocable trust purporting to penalize any interested person for contesting the validity of the trust or instituting other proceedings relating to the trust is unenforceable if probable cause exists for instituting proceedings.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-606. Anti-lapse provision in trust.

(A) Unless the trust expressly provides otherwise, if the beneficiary under a revocable trust, who is a great-grandparent or a lineal descendant of a great-grandparent of the settlor, is dead at the time of execution of the trust, fails to survive the settlor, or is treated as if he predeceased the settlor, the issue of the deceased beneficiary who survived the settlor take in place of the deceased beneficiary and if they are all of the same degree of kinship to the beneficiary they take equally, but if of unequal degree then those of more remote degree take by representation. One who would have been a beneficiary under a class gift if he had survived the settlor is treated as a beneficiary for purposes of this section whether his death occurred before or after the execution of the trust.

(B) Except as provided in subsection (A), if the disposition of any real or personal property under a revocable trust fails for any reason, this property becomes a part of the residue of the trust.

(C) Except as provided in subsection (A), if the residue under a revocable trust is distributed to two or more persons and the share of one of the residuary beneficiaries fails for any reason, his share passes to the other residuary beneficiary or to other residuary beneficiaries in proportion to their interests in the residue.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-607. Divorce or annulment as revoking revocable trust.

If after executing a revocable trust the settlor is divorced or the marriage annulled or the spouse is a party to a valid proceeding concluded by an order purporting to terminate all marital property rights or confirming equitable distribution between spouses, the divorce or annulment or order revokes any disposition or appointment of property including beneficial interests made by such trust to the spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the spouse, and any nomination of the spouse as trustee, unless the trust expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment or order passes as if the spouse failed to survive the settlor, and other provisions conferring some power or office on this spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the settlor. If these provisions for the spouse are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the settlor's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment or order means any divorce or annulment or order which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of subsections (a) and (b) of Section 62-2-802. A decree of separate maintenance which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of marital circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a disposition to a spouse in a revocable trust.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

Effect of Amendment

The 2013 amendment substituted "If these provisions for the spouse" for "If provisions", in the third sentence; in the last sentence, deleted "or parental" before "change of marital" and inserted "a disposition to a spouse in" before "a revocable trust"; and made other nonsubstantive changes.

(1) act to preserve the trust property if, within a reasonable time after acting, the person sends a rejection of the trusteeship to the settlor or, if the settlor is dead or lacks capacity, to a qualified beneficiary; and

(2) inspect or investigate trust property to determine potential liability under environmental or other law or for any other purpose.

However, in no event shall bond be required of a trustee, including a trustee appointed by the court, if the governing instrument directs otherwise. On petition of the trustee or other interested person, the court may excuse a requirement of bond, reduce the amount of the bond, release the surety, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

(d) If a cotrustee is unavailable to perform duties because of absence, illness, disqualification under other law, or other temporary incapacity, and prompt action is necessary to achieve the purposes of the trust or to avoid injury to the trust property, the remaining cotrustee or a majority of the remaining cotrustees may act for the trust.

(e) A trustee may not delegate to a cotrustee the performance of a function the settlor reasonably expected the trustees to perform jointly. Unless a delegation was irrevocable, a trustee may revoke a delegation previously made.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a trustee who does not join in an action of another trustee is not liable for the action.

(2) by a person selected by the charitable organizations expressly designated to receive distributions under the terms of the trust if the Attorney General concurs in the selection; or

(3) by a person appointed by the court.

(a) For the reasons set forth in subsection (b), the settlor, a cotrustee, or a beneficiary may request the court to remove a trustee, or a trustee may be removed by the court on its own initiative.

(b) The court may remove a trustee if:

(1) the trustee has committed a serious breach of trust;

(2) lack of cooperation among cotrustees substantially impairs the administration of the trust;

(3) because of unfitness, unwillingness, or persistent failure of the trustee to administer the trust effectively, the court determines that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of the beneficiaries; or

(4) there has been a substantial change of circumstances or removal is requested by all of the qualified beneficiaries, the court finds that removal of the trustee best serves the interests of all of the beneficiaries and is not inconsistent with a material purpose of the trust, and a suitable cotrustee or successor trustee is available.

(3) If all of the serving fiduciaries are disqualified from exercising a power, the court that would have jurisdiction to appoint a fiduciary under the instrument, if there were no fiduciary currently serving, shall exercise, or shall appoint a special fiduciary whose only power is to exercise the power that cannot be exercised by the other fiduciaries by reason of subsection (c).

(4) A trustee may not exercise a power to make discretionary distributions to satisfy a legal obligation of support that the trustee personally owes another person.

(d) Subsection (c) does not apply to:

(1) a power held by the settlor's spouse who is the trustee of a trust for which a marital deduction, as defined in Section 2056(b)(5) or 2523(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, was previously allowed;

(2) any trust during any period that the trust may be revoked or amended by its settlor; or

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-816A. Authority to appoint the property of original trust to second trust.

(a) Unless the terms of the instrument expressly provide otherwise, a trustee with the discretion to make distributions of principal or income to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust, the original trust, may exercise that discretion by appointing all or part of the property subject to that discretion in favor of another trust for the benefit of one or more of those beneficiaries, the second trust. This power may be exercised without the approval of a court, but court approval is necessary if the terms of the original trust expressly prohibit the exercise of such power or require court approval.

(b) The trustee of the original trust may exercise this power whether or not there is a current need to distribute principal or income under any standard provided in the original trust. The trustee's special power to appoint trust principal or income in further trust under this section includes the power to create the second trust.

(c) The second trust may be a trust created under the same trust instrument as the original trust or under a different trust instrument, and the trustee of the second trust may be either the trustee of the original trust or another trustee.

(d) The terms of the second trust are subject to the following requirements:

(1) The beneficiaries of the second trust may include only beneficiaries of the original trust.

(2) A beneficiary who has only a future beneficial interest, vested or contingent, in the original trust cannot have the future beneficial interest accelerated to a present interest in the second trust.

(3) The terms of the second trust may not contain any provision nor reduce any fixed income, annuity, or unitrust interest of a beneficiary in the assets of an original trust document if the inclusion of the provision or reduction in the original trust document would have disqualified any assets of the original trust for any federal or state income, estate, or gift tax deduction received on account of any assets of the original trust, or if the inclusion of the provision or reduction in the original trust would have reduced the amount of any federal or state income, estate, or gift tax deduction received. In addition, the terms of the second trust may not reduce any retained interest of a beneficiary of the original trust if the interest is a qualified interest under Internal Revenue Code Section 2702.

(4) If contributions to the original trust have been excluded from the gift tax by the application of Internal Revenue Code Section 2503(b) and Section 2503(c), then the second trust shall provide that the beneficiary's remainder interest in the contributions shall vest and become distributable no later than the date upon which the interest would have vested and become distributable under the terms of the original trust.

(5) If a beneficiary of the original trust has a power of withdrawal over trust property, then either:

(A) the terms of the second trust must provide a power of withdrawal in the second trust identical to the power of withdrawal in the original trust; or

(B) sufficient trust property must remain in the original trust to satisfy the outstanding power of withdrawal.

(6) If the power to distribute principal or income in the original trust is subject to an ascertainable standard, then the power to distribute income or principal in the second trust must be subject to the same ascertainable standard as in the original trust and must be exercisable in favor of the same beneficiaries as in the original trust.

(7) The second trust may confer a power of appointment upon a beneficiary of the original trust to whom or for the benefit of whom the trustee has the power to distribute principal or income of the original trust. The permissible appointees of the power of appointment conferred upon a beneficiary may include persons who are not beneficiaries of the original or second trust.

(e) A trustee may not exercise the power to appoint principal or income under subsection (a) of this section if the trustee is a beneficiary of the original trust, but the remaining cotrustee or a majority of the remaining cotrustees may act for the trust. If all the trustees are beneficiaries of the original trust, then the court may appoint a special fiduciary with authority to exercise the power to appoint principal or income under subsection (a) of this section.

(f) The exercise of the power to appoint principal or income under subsection (a) of this section:

(1) is considered the exercise of a power of appointment, other than a power to appoint to the trustee, the trustee's creditors, the trustee's estate or the creditors of the trustee's estate;

(2) does not result in the trustee or cotrustees of the original trust being considered the settlor of the second trust;

(3) is not prohibited by a spendthrift provision or by a provision in the trust instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust.

(g) To effect the exercise of the power to appoint principal or income under subsection (a) of this section, all of the following apply:

(1) The exercise of the power to appoint must be made by an instrument in writing, signed and acknowledged by the trustee, setting forth the manner of the exercise of the power, including the terms of the second trust, and the effective date of the exercise of the power. The instrument must be filed with the records of the original trust.

(2) The trustee shall give written notice to all qualified beneficiaries of the original trust, at least ninety days prior to the effective date of the exercise of the power to appoint, of the trustee's intention to exercise the power. The notice must include a copy of the instrument described in item (1) of this subsection.

(3) If all qualified beneficiaries waive the notice period by a signed written instrument delivered to the trustee, the trustee's power to appoint principal or income is exercisable after notice is waived by all qualified beneficiaries, notwithstanding the effective date of the exercise of the power.

(h) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to create or imply a duty of the trustee to exercise the power to distribute principal or income, or to create an inference of impropriety made as a result of a trustee not exercising the power to appoint principal or income conferred under subsection (a) of this section. The provisions of this section shall not be construed to abridge the right of any trustee who has a power to appoint property in further trust that arises under the terms of the original trust or under any other section of this article or under another provision of law or under common law. The terms of an original trust may modify or waive the notice requirements under subsection (g), reduce or increase restrictions on altering the interests of beneficiaries under subsection (d), and may otherwise contain provisions that are inconsistent with the requirements of this section.

(i) A trustee or beneficiary may commence a proceeding to approve or disapprove a proposed exercise of the trustee's special power to appoint to another trust pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.

(j) The provisions of Section 62-7-109 regarding notices and the sending of documents to persons under this article apply for the purposes of notices and the sending of documents under this section.

SECTION 62-7-817. Distribution upon termination.

(a) Upon termination or partial termination of a trust, the trustee may send to the beneficiaries a proposal for distribution. The right of any beneficiary to object to the proposed distribution terminates if the beneficiary does not notify the trustee of an objection within 30 days after the proposal was sent but only if the proposal informed the beneficiary of the right to object and of the time allowed for objection.

(b) Upon the occurrence of an event terminating or partially terminating a trust, the trustee shall proceed expeditiously to distribute the trust property to the persons entitled to it, subject to the right of the trustee to retain a reasonable reserve for the payment of debts, expenses, and taxes.

(c) A release by a beneficiary of a trustee from liability for breach of trust is invalid to the extent:

(1) it was induced by improper conduct of the trustee; or

(2) the beneficiary, at the time of the release, did not know of the beneficiary's rights or of the material facts relating to the breach.

These powers and discretion may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) modify or amend the trust instrument to achieve favorable tax status or respond to changes in the Internal Revenue Code, state law, or the rulings and regulations thereunder;

(2) increase or decrease the interests of any beneficiaries to the trust;

(4) remove and appoint a trustee, trust advisor, investment committee member, or distribution committee member;

(5) terminate the trust;

(6) veto or direct trust distributions;

(7) change situs or governing law of the trust, or both;

(10) advise the trustee on matters concerning a beneficiary; and

(11) amend or modify the trust instrument to take advantage of laws governing restraints on alienation, distribution of trust property, or the administration of the trust.

The powers referenced in items (5), (6) and (11) may be granted notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 62-7-410 through 62-7-412, inclusive.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-819. Powers of a trust investment advisor.

(a) Whenever a trust instrument provides that a trustee is to follow the direction of a trust investment advisor with respect to investment decisions or distribution decisions, then, except to the extent that the trust instrument provides otherwise, the trustee has no duty to:

(1) monitor the conduct of the trust investment advisor;

(2) provide advice to the trust investment advisor; or

(3) communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the trustee would or might have exercised the trustee's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the advisor.

(b) Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the trustee pertaining to matters within the scope of the trust investment advisor's authority, such as confirming that the trust investment advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the trust investment advisor's direction, are presumed to be administrative actions taken by the trustee solely to allow the trustee to perform those duties assigned to the trustee under the governing instrument and these administrative actions are not deemed to constitute an undertaking by the trustee to monitor the trust investment advisor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the trust investment advisor's authority.

(c) For purposes of this section, "investment decision" means, with respect to any investment, the retention, purchase, sale, exchange, tender or other transaction affecting the ownership thereof, or rights therein.

SECTION 62-7-904. Adjustments between principal and income.

(A) A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying the provisions in Section 62-7-903(A), that the trustee is unable to comply with Section 62-7-903(B). In lieu of exercising the power to adjust, the trustee may convert the trust to a unitrust as permitted under Sections 62-7-904A through 62-7-904P, in which case the unitrust amount becomes the net income of the trust.

(B) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in subsection (A), a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including, but not limited to:

(1) the nature, purpose, and expected duration of the trust;

(2) the intent of the settlor;

(3) the identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries;

(4) the needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital;

(5) the assets held in the trust and the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property and the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary, and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor;

(6) the net amount otherwise allocated to income under other sections of the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available;

(7) whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income;

(8) the actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and

(9) the anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.

(C) A trustee may not make an adjustment:

(1) that diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a surviving spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction is allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment, but only to the extent that making such an adjustment would cause adverse tax consequences under applicable tax laws and regulations;

(2) that reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion;

(3) that changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets;

(4) from any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside, but only to the extent that making such an adjustment would cause adverse tax consequences under applicable tax laws and regulations;

(5) if possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment is determinative in causing an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;

(6) if possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment is determinative in causing all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment;

(7) if the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust;

(8) if the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly, except that a trustee may make an adjustment that also benefits a beneficiary even if the terms of the trust provide for trustee compensation as a percentage of the trust's income; or

(9) if the trust has been converted to, and is then operating as a unitrust under Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P.

(D) If subsection (C)(5), (6), (7), or (8) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.

(E) A trustee may release the entire power of adjustment in subsection (A) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power causes a result described in subsections (C)(1) through (6) or subsection (C)(8) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not contemplated in subsection (C). The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.

(F) Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power to adjust in subsection (A).

Effect of Amendment

The 2010 amendment in subsection (B)(7) deleted ", or prohibit him from," following "give the trustee the power to".

The 2013 amendment rewrote subsections (A), (B), and (C), and made nonsubstantive changes in subsections (E) and (F).

SECTION 62-7-904A. Judicial control of discretionary power.

(A) A court may not change a fiduciary's decision, or order a fiduciary to change its decision, to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. A fiduciary's decision is not an abuse of discretion merely because the court would have exercised the power in a different manner or would not have exercised the power.

(B) The decisions subject to subsection (A) include, but are not limited to, a determination:

(1) pursuant to Section 62-7-904(A) of whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal; and

(2) of the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which they are relevant, and the weight, if any, to be given to the relevant factors, in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power in Section 62-7-904(A).

(C) If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused its discretion, the court may place the income and remainder beneficiaries in the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, according to the following rules:

(1) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in no distribution to a beneficiary or in a distribution that is too small, the court must order the fiduciary to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to the beneficiary's appropriate position;

(2) to the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court must place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in whole or in part, in their appropriate positions by ordering the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or ordering that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust;

(3) to the extent that the court is unable, after applying items (1) and (2), to place the beneficiaries, the trust, or both, in the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, the court may order the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to one or more of the beneficiaries or the trust, or both.

(D) Upon a petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over the trust or estate must determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power in the South Carolina Uniform Principal and Income Act would result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion. If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries would be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.

(C) All proceedings under this section must be conducted as provided in Part 2 of this article.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904E. Fair market value of trust assets.

(A) The fair market value of the trust assets must be determined at least annually, using a valuation date selected by the trustee in its discretion. The trustee, in its discretion, may use an average of the fair market value on the same valuation date for the current fiscal year and not more than three preceding fiscal years, if the use of this average appears desirable to the trustee to reduce the impact of fluctuations in market value on the unitrust amount. Assets for which a fair market value cannot be readily ascertained must be valued using valuation methods as are considered reasonable and appropriate by the trustee. Assets, such as a residence or tangible personal property, used by the trust beneficiary may be excluded by the trustee from the fair market value for computing the unitrust amount.

(B) The percentage to be used by the trustee in determining the unitrust amount must be a reasonable current return from the trust, but not less than three percent nor more than five percent, taking into account the intentions of the settlor of the trust as expressed in the terms of the trust, the needs of the beneficiaries, general economic conditions, projected current earnings and appreciation for the trust assets, and projected inflation and its impact on the trust.

(C) Following the conversion of an income trust to a total return unitrust, the trustee:

(1) shall consider the unitrust amount as paid from net accounting income determined as if the trust were not a unitrust;

(2) shall then consider the unitrust amount as paid from ordinary income not allocable to net accounting income;

(3) may, in the trustee's discretion, consider the unitrust amount as paid from net short-term gain described in Section 1222(5) of the Code and then from net long-term capital gain described in Section 1222(7) of the Code so long as the discretionary power is exercised consistently and in a reasonable and impartial manner, but the amount so paid from net capital gains may not be greater than the excess of the unitrust amount over the amount of distributable net income as defined in Section 643(a) of the Code without regard to Section 1.643(a)-3(b) of the Treasury Regulations, as amended from time to time; and

(4) shall then consider the unitrust amount as coming from the principal of the trust.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904F. Administration of a total return unitrust.

In administering a total return unitrust, the trustee may, in its sole discretion but subject to the terms of the trust, determine:

(1) the effective date of the conversion;

(2) the timing of distributions, including provisions for prorating a distribution for a short year in which a beneficiary's right to payments commences or ceases;

(3) whether distributions are to be made in cash or in kind or partly in cash and partly in kind;

(4) if the trust is reconverted to an income trust, the effective date of the reconversion; and

(5) any other administrative issues as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904G. Distribution of unitrust amount considered distribution of income and not of principal.

Conversion to a total return unitrust under Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P does not affect any other provision of the terms of the trust, if any, regarding distributions of principal. For purposes of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P, the distribution of a unitrust amount is considered a distribution of income and not of principal.

SECTION 62-7-904H. Limitation of liability.

No trustee or disinterested person who in good faith takes or fails to take any action under Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P is liable to any person affected by the action or inaction, regardless of whether the person received written notice as provided in Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P and regardless of whether the person was under a legal disability at the time of the delivery of the notice. The exclusive remedy for any person affected by such action or inaction is to obtain an order of the court directing the trustee to:

(1) convert an income trust to a total return unitrust;

(2) reconvert from a total return unitrust to an income trust; or

(3) change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount.

SECTION 62-7-904I. Applicability of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P.

Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P apply to all trusts in existence on, or created after the effective date of Sections 62-7-904A through 62-7-904P unless:

(1) the governing instrument contains a provision clearly expressing the settlor's intention that the current beneficiary or beneficiaries are to receive an amount other than a reasonable current return from the trust;

(2) the trust is a trust described in Section 170(f)(2)(B), Section 664(d), Section 2702(a)(3), or Section 2702(b) of the Code;

(3) the trust is a trust under which any amount is, or has been in the past, set aside permanently for charitable purposes unless the income from the trust also is devoted permanently to charitable purposes; or

(4) the governing instrument expressly prohibits use of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P by specific reference to Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P or expressly states the settlor's intent that net income not be calculated as a unitrust amount.

A provision in the terms of the trust that "the provisions of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P of this part or any corresponding provision of future law, must not be used in the administration of this trust," or "the trustee shall not determine the distributions to the income beneficiary as a unitrust amount," or similar words reflecting that intent is sufficient to preclude the use of Sections 62-7-904B through 62-7-904P.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904M. Unitrust amount to be distributed by the express total return unitrust.

(A) The unitrust amount to be distributed by the express total return unitrust may be determined by the terms of the unitrust governing instrument by reference to the net fair market value of the trust's assets determined annually or averaged on a multiple-year basis.

(B) The terms of an express total return unitrust governing instrument may provide that:

(1) any assets of such a unitrust for which a fair market value cannot be readily ascertained must be valued using valuation methods that the trustee considers reasonable and appropriate;

(2) any assets of such a unitrust, such as a residence property or tangible personal property, used by the trust beneficiary entitled to the unitrust amount may be excluded by the trustee from the net fair market value for computing the unitrust amount.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904N. Distribution from an express total return unitrust.

The distribution from an express total return unitrust of a unitrust amount equal to a fixed percentage of not less than three percent nor more than five percent reasonably apportions between the income beneficiaries and the remainder of the total return of an express total return unitrust.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904O. Express total return unitrust governing instrument; changing the unitrust percentage; converting from a unitrust to an income trust; reconversion of an income trust to a unitrust.

(A) The terms of an express total return unitrust governing instrument may provide the method similar to the method provided under Section 62-7-904C for changing the unitrust percentage or for converting from a unitrust to an income trust or for a reconversion of an income trust to a unitrust, or for all of these actions.

(B) If the terms of an express total return unitrust governing instrument do not specifically or by reference to Section 62-7-904C grant a power to the trustee to change the unitrust percentage or change to an income trust, the trustee shall not have that power.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-904P. Trustee considerations for unitrust amount paid.

Unless the terms of the express total return unitrust governing instrument specifically provide otherwise, the trustee:

(A) shall consider the unitrust amount as paid from net accounting income determined as if the trust were not a unitrust;

(B) shall then consider the unitrust amount as paid from ordinary income not allocable to net accounting income;

(C) may, in the trustee's discretion, consider the unitrust amount as paid from net short-term gain described in Section 1222(5) of the Code and then from net long-term capital gain described in Section 1222(7) of the Code so long as this discretionary power is exercised consistently and in a reasonable and impartial manner, but the amount so paid from net capital gains may not be greater than the excess of the unitrust amount over the amount of distributable net income as defined in Section 643(a) of the Code without regard to Section 1.643(a)-3(b) of the Treasury Regulations; and

(D) shall then consider the unitrust amount as coming from the principal of the trust.

HISTORY: 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-905. Determinations of income and principal; distributions upon death or end of an income interest in a trust.

After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, a fiduciary:

(1) of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary pursuant to Sections 62-7-907 through 62-7-930 which apply to trustees and the provisions of item (5). The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property;

(2) shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest pursuant to Sections 62-7-907 through 62-7-930 which apply to trustees and by:

(a) including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities;

(b) paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants, and fiduciaries, court costs and other expenses of administration, and interest on death taxes; except that the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income does not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction; and

(c) paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances, and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law;

(3) shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the rate of interest or other amount provided by the will or the terms of the trust. If the will or the terms of the trust provide no interest amount, the beneficiary of a pecuniary amount outright shall receive no interest or other income on the bequest for one year after the first appointment of a personal representative. Beginning one year after the first appointment of a personal representative, and notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the beneficiary of a pecuniary amount outright must be treated as any other beneficiary under item (4). If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust, the fiduciary shall treat the pecuniary amount as if it were required to be paid under a will and as if the payment were being made beginning one year after the first appointment of a personal representative;

(4) shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by item (3) in the manner pursuant to Section 62-7-906 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust; and

(5) may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in item (1) because of a payment pursuant to Sections 62-7-924 and 62-7-925 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust, or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party. The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on, or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-7-906. Determination and distribution of net income.

(A) Each beneficiary described in Section 62-7-905(4) is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to his fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date. If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.

(B) In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the:

(1) beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to his fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations;

(2) fractional interest of the beneficiary in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust;

(3) fractional interest of the beneficiary in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation; and

(4) distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.

(B) An asset becomes subject to a trust on the date:

(1) it is transferred to the trust, in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life;

(2) the testator dies, in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the estate; or

(3) the individual dies, in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the death of the individual.

(C) An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined pursuant to subsection (D), even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.

(D) An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.

SECTION 62-7-908. Allocation of income receipts and disbursements.

(A) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement, other than one subject to Section 62-7-905(1), to principal if its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.

(B) A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date. An income receipt or disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date. The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal and the balance must be allocated to income.

(C) An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment. If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this part. Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity subject to Section 62-7-910 are considered due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution. A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

(B) When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust, unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends. In that case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.

(C) When the obligation of a trustee to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment if, and to the extent, required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate, or other tax requirements.

(2) if the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than twenty percent of the entity's gross assets of the entity, as shown by the year-end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.

(E) Money is not received in partial liquidation, nor may it be taken into account pursuant to subsection (D)(2), to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary must pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.

(F) A trustee may rely upon a statement made by an entity about the source or character of a distribution if the statement is made at or near the time of distribution by the board of directors or other person or group of persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property comparable to those of a corporation's board of directors.

SECTION 62-7-912. Separate accounting for a business activity.

(A) If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the general accounting records of the trust, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.

(B) A trustee who accounts separately for a business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts must be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity, and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the general accounting records of the trust to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business.

(C) Activities for which a trustee may maintain separate accounting records include:

(1) retail, manufacturing, service, and other traditional business activities;

If the obligation matures within one year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, an amount received in excess of its purchase price or its value when acquired by the trust must be allocated to income.

(C) This section does not apply to an obligation subject to Section 62-7-918, 62-7-919, 62-7-920, 62-7-921, or 62-7-924.

This power may be exercised by a cotrustee in the circumstances provided in Section 62-7-904(D) and may be released for the reasons and in the manner provided in Section 62-7-904(E). An allocation is presumed to be insubstantial if:

(1) the amount of the allocation increases or decreases net income in an accounting period, as determined before the allocation, by less than ten percent; or

SECTION 62-7-918. Allocation of payments; interest, dividends, or payments.

(A) In this section:

(1) "Payment" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer. For purposes of subsections (D), (E), (F), and (G), the term also includes a payment from a separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment.

(2) "Separate fund" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan.

(B) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or a payment made instead of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment.

(C) If part of a payment is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If a part of a payment is not required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not "required to be made" to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal.

(D) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (E), subsections (F) and (G) apply, and subsections (B) and (C) do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to:

(1) a trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, has been made; or

(2) a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

(E) Subsections (D), (F), and (G) do not apply if and to the extent that the series of payments would, without the application of subsection (D), qualify for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

(F) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this act. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period.

(G) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four percent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.

(H) This section does not apply to payments subject to Section 62-7-919.

(B) A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to principal must be paid from principal, even if the tax is called an income tax by the taxing authority.

(C) A tax required to be paid by a trustee on the trust's share of the taxable income of the entity must be paid:

(1) from income, to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocated to income;

Effect of Amendment

The 2012 amendment rewrote subsections (C) and (D).

SECTION 62-7-930. Certain adjustments between principal and income; reduction of marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction.

(A) A fiduciary may make adjustments between principal and income to offset the shifting of economic interests or tax benefits between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries which arise from:

(1) elections and decisions, other than those provided in subsection (B), that the fiduciary makes from time to time regarding tax matters;

(2) an income tax or any other tax that is imposed upon the fiduciary or a beneficiary as a result of a transaction involving or a distribution from the estate or trust; or

(3) the ownership by an estate or trust of an interest in an entity whose taxable income, whether or not distributed, is includable in the taxable income of the estate, trust, or a beneficiary.

(B) If the amount of an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction is reduced because a fiduciary deducts an amount paid from principal for income tax purposes instead of deducting it for estate tax purposes, and as a result estate taxes paid from principal are increased and income taxes paid by an estate, trust, or beneficiary are decreased, each estate, trust, or beneficiary that benefits from the decrease in income tax shall reimburse the principal from which the increase in estate tax is paid. The total reimbursement must equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent that the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust, or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced must be the same as its proportionate share of the total decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from income.

Part 9A

South Carolina Uniform Prudent Investor Act

SECTION 62-7-933. Uniform Prudent Investor Act.

(A) This section may be cited as the South Carolina Uniform Prudent Investor Act, or this act.

(B)(1) Except as otherwise provided in item (2) of this subsection, a trustee who invests and manages trust assets owes a duty to the beneficiaries of the trust to comply with the prudent investor rule in this act.

(2) The prudent investor rule is a default rule that may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the provisions of a trust. A trustee is not liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reasonable reliance on the provisions of the trust.

(C)(1) A trustee shall invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would by considering the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust. In satisfying this standard, the trustee shall exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution.

(2) A trustee's investment and management decisions respecting individual assets must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust.

(3) Among other circumstances provided in item (1) of this subsection which a trustee shall consider in investing and managing trust assets are such of the following as are relevant to the trust or its beneficiaries:

(a) general economic conditions;

(b) the possible effect of inflation or deflation;

(c) the expected tax consequences of investment decisions or strategies;

(d) the role that each investment or course of action plays within the overall trust portfolio, including financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, and real property;

(e) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital;

(f) other resources of the beneficiaries;

(g) needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital; and

(h) an asset's special relationship or special value to the purposes of the trust or to one or more of the beneficiaries.

(4) A trustee shall make a reasonable effort to verify facts relevant to the investment and management of trust assets.

(5)(a) A trustee may invest in any kind of property or type of investment consistent with the standards of this act.

(b) Nothing in this act prohibits affiliate investments if they otherwise comply with the standards of this act. For these purposes, 'affiliate' means an entity that owns or is owned by the trustee, in whole or in part, or is owned by the same entity that owns the trustee. Affiliate investments include:

(i) investment and reinvestment in the securities of an open-end or closed-end management investment company or of an investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. A bank or trustee, or both of them, may invest in these securities even if the bank or trustee, or an affiliate of the bank or trustee, provides services to the investment company or investment trust such as that of an investment advisor, custodian, transfer agent, registrar, sponsor, distributor, manager, or otherwise, and receives reasonable remuneration for those services;

(ii) retention of the securities into which corporate securities owned by the trustee may be converted or which may be derived as a result of merger, consolidation, stock dividends, splits, liquidations, and similar procedures, and the exercise by purchase or otherwise any rights, warrants, or conversion features attaching to the securities;

(iii) purchase or other acquisition and retention of a security underwritten by a syndicate, even if the trustee or its affiliate participates or has participated as a member of the syndicate, provided the trustee does not purchase the security from itself, its affiliate, or from another member of the underwriting syndicate, or its affiliate, pursuant to an implied or express reciprocal agreement between the trustee, or its affiliate, and the other member, or its affiliate, to purchase all or part of each other's underwriting participation commitment within the syndicate.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any fiduciary holding securities in its fiduciary capacity, any bank, trust company, or private banker holding securities as a custodian or managing agent, and any bank, trust company, or private banker holding securities as custodian for a fiduciary, is authorized to deposit or arrange for the deposit of such securities in a clearing corporation, as defined in Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code. When such securities are so deposited, certificates representing securities of the same class of the same issuer may be merged and held in bulk in the name of the nominee of such clearing corporation with any other such securities deposited in such clearing corporation by any person regardless of the ownership of such securities, and certificates of small denomination may be merged into one or more certificates of larger denomination. The records of such fiduciary and the records of such bank, trust company, or private banker acting as custodian, as managing agent or as custodian for a fiduciary shall at all times show the name of the party for whose account the securities are so deposited. Ownership of, and other interests in, such securities may be transferred by bookkeeping entry on the books of such clearing corporation without physical delivery of certificates representing such securities. A bank, trust company, or private banker so depositing securities pursuant to this section shall be subject to such regulations as in the case of state-chartered institutions, the Board of Financial Institutions, and, in the case of national banking associations, The Comptroller of the Currency may from time to time issue. A bank, trust company, or private banker acting as custodian for a fiduciary shall, on demand by the fiduciary, certify in writing to the fiduciary the securities so deposited by such bank, trust company, or private banker in such clearing corporation for the account of such fiduciary. A fiduciary shall, on demand by any party to a judicial proceeding for the settlement of such fiduciary's account or on demand by the attorney for such party, certify in writing to such party the securities deposited by such fiduciary in such clearing corporation for its account as such fiduciary. This subsection shall apply to any fiduciary holding securities in its fiduciary capacity, and to any bank, trust company, or private banker holding securities as a custodian, managing agent, or custodian for a fiduciary, acting on April 17, 1973, or who thereafter may act regardless of the date of the agreement, instrument, or court order by which it is appointed and regardless of whether or not such fiduciary, custodian, managing agent, or custodian for a fiduciary owns capital stock of such clearing corporation.

(6) [Reserved.]

(D) A trustee shall diversify the investments of the trust unless the trustee reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the trust are better served without diversifying.

(E) Within a reasonable time after accepting a trusteeship or receiving trust assets, a trustee shall review the trust assets and make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of assets in order to bring the trust portfolio into compliance with the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust and with the requirements of this act.

(F) [Reserved.]

(G) Compliance with the prudent investor rule is determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of a trustee's decision or action and not by hindsight.

(H) [Reserved.]

(I) The following terms or comparable language in the provisions of a trust, unless otherwise limited or modified, authorize any investment or strategy permitted pursuant to this act: "investments permissible by law for investment of trust funds", "legal investments", "authorized investments", "using the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of their capital", "prudent man rule", "prudent trustee rule", "prudent person rule", and "prudent investor rule".

(J)(1) Notwithstanding provisions of this act to the contrary, the duties of a trustee with respect to acquiring a contract of insurance upon the life of the trustor or upon the lives of the trustor and the trustor's spouse, children, or parents do not include a duty to:

(a) determine whether the contract is or remains a proper investment;

(b) exercise policy options available under the contract; or

(c) diversify the contract.

(2) The trustee is not liable to the beneficiaries of the contract of insurance or to another party for loss arising from this subsection.

(3) Except as specifically provided in the trust instrument, the provisions of this subsection apply to a trust established before or after the effective date of this subsection and to a life insurance policy acquired by the trustee before or after the effective date of this act.

(K) This act applies to "charitable remainder trusts". "Charitable remainder trust" means a trust that provides for a specified distribution at least annually for either life or a term of years to one or more beneficiaries, at least one of which is not a charity with an irrevocable remainder interest to be held for the benefit of, or paid over to, charity.

(L) This act must be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this act among the States enacting it.

HISTORY: 2005 Act No. 66, Section 1; 2010 Act No. 244, Section 57, eff June 7, 2010; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 2, eff January 1, 2014.

Effect of Amendment

The 2010 amendment in subsection (C)(3) substituted "Among other circumstances provided in item (1) of this subsection which a" for "A", and substituted "are such" for "those circumstances" following "investing and managing trust assets".

The 2013 amendment made nonsubstantive changes.

(f) A person who acts in reliance upon a certification of trust without knowledge that the representations contained therein are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification. Knowledge of the terms of the trust may not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying upon the certification.

(g) A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance upon a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.

(h) A person making a demand for the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust or excerpts is liable for damages if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith in demanding the trust instrument.

(i) This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust.

(j) In a transaction involving title to real property, the certificate of trust must be executed and acknowledged in a manner that permits its recordation in the Office of the Register of Deeds or Clerk of Court in the county in which the real property is located.
