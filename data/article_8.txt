(1) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency, the principal, in the power of attorney, may authorize one or more persons to determine in a writing or other record that the event or contingency has occurred.

(2) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal's incapacity and the principal has not authorized a person to determine whether the principal is incapacitated, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the power of attorney becomes effective upon a determination in a writing or other record by:

(A) a physician or licensed psychologist that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of Section 62-8-102(5)(A); or

(B) attorney at law, court of competent jurisdiction, or an appropriate governmental official that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of Section 62-8-102(5)(B).

Section 1320d, as amended, and applicable regulations, to obtain access to the principal's health care information and communicate with the principal's health care provider.

(c) After the principal's incapacity, an agent may exercise the authority granted unto the agent under the power of attorney only if the power of attorney has been recorded in the same manner as a deed in the county where the principal resides at the time the instrument is recorded. If the principal resides out of State, the power of attorney may be recorded in any county where property of the principal is located at the time the instrument is recorded. The power of attorney may be recorded before or after the principal's incapacity. After the principal's incapacity and before recordation, the agent's authority cannot be exercised.

(d) An agent may exercise a power of attorney executed in another jurisdiction if its execution complies with Section 62-8-106 if, after the principal's incapacity, it is recorded as required in subsection (c). Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 30-5-30, a valid power of attorney as provided for pursuant to this part, which is executed in another jurisdiction, may be recorded as though it complies with the provisions of Section 30-5-30.

(4) power of attorney provides that it terminates;

(d) Termination of an agent's authority or of a power of attorney is not effective as to the agent or another person that, without actual knowledge of the termination, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.

(e) Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.

(f) The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked.

(g) Unless otherwise provided in the power of attorney, a revocation of a power of attorney must be executed in accordance with Sections 62-8-105 and 62-8-106 and, if the power of attorney has been recorded, then the revocation also must be recorded in the same county as the recorded power of attorney.

A principal may grant authority to designate one or more successor agents to an agent or other person designated by name, office, or function. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent:

(1) has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and

(2) may not act until all predecessor agents have resigned, died, become incapacitated, are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney and subsection (d), an agent that does not participate in or conceal a breach of fiduciary duty committed by another agent, including a predecessor agent, is not liable for the actions of the other agent.

(d) An agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal's best interest. An agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this subsection is liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the principal or taken such action.
