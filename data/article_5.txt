SECTION 62-5-108. Temporary orders and hearings.

(A) The process for emergency orders without notice, emergency hearings, duration, and security is as follows:

(1) Emergency orders without notice must not be issued unless the moving party files a summons, motion for emergency order with supporting affidavit(s), verified pleading, notice of emergency hearing, and any other document required by the court. The verified pleading, motions, and affidavits shall set forth specific facts supporting the allegation that an immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result before notice can be served on adverse parties and a hearing held pursuant to subsection (B).

(a) If emergency relief is required to protect the welfare of an alleged incapacitated individual, the moving party must present an affidavit from a physician who has performed an examination within thirty days prior to the filing of the action, a motion for the appointment of counsel if counsel has not been retained, and a motion for the appointment of a proposed qualified individual to serve as guardian ad litem.

(b) If the emergency relief requested is an order for:

(i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or

(ii) the removal of an existing guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, then the moving party must submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary.

(2) If the motion for an emergency order is not granted, the moving party may seek temporary relief after notice pursuant to subsection (B) or proceed to a final hearing.

(3) If the motion for an emergency order is granted, the date and hour of its issuance must be endorsed on the order. The date and time for the emergency hearing must be entered on the notice of hearing and it must be no later than ten days from the date of the order or as the court determines is reasonable for good cause shown.

(4) The moving party shall serve all pleadings on the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person and other adverse parties immediately after issuance of the emergency order.

(5) If the moving party does not appear at the emergency hearing, the court may dissolve the emergency order without notice.

(6) Evidence admitted at the hearing may be limited to pleadings and supporting affidavits. Upon good cause shown or at the court's direction, additional evidence may be admitted.

(7) On two days' notice to the party who obtained the emergency order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move for the emergency order's dissolution or modification, and in that event, the court shall proceed to hear and determine the motion as expeditiously as possible and may consolidate motions.

(8) No emergency order for conservatorship must be issued except upon the court receiving adequate assurances the assets will be protected, which may include providing of security by the moving party in a sum the court deems proper for costs and damages incurred by any party who without just cause is aggrieved as a result of the emergency order. A surety upon a bond or undertaking submits to the jurisdiction of the court.

(9) The court may take whatever actions it deems necessary to protect assets, including, but not limited to, issuing an order to freeze accounts.

(B) The process for temporary orders and temporary hearings with notice is as follows:

(1) A temporary order must not be issued without notice to the adverse party.

(2) An order for a temporary hearing must not be issued unless the moving party files a summons, motion for temporary hearing with supporting affidavits, and a petition or other appropriate pleading setting forth specific facts supporting the allegation that immediate relief is needed during the pendency of the action, and an affidavit of service of the notice of the temporary hearing to adverse parties.

(a) If temporary relief is required to protect the welfare of an alleged incapacitated individual, in addition to the requirements set forth above in subsection (B)(2), the moving party shall present an affidavit from a physician who has performed an examination within forty-five days prior to the filing of the action, a motion for the appointment of counsel if counsel has not been retained, and a motion for appointment of a proposed qualified individual to serve as guardian ad litem.

(b) If the temporary relief requested is an order for:

(i) appointment of a temporary guardian, conservator, guardian ad litem, or other fiduciary; or

(ii) removal of an existing guardian, conservator or other fiduciary, and the appointment of a substitute, in addition to the requirements set forth in subsection (B)(2) and (a), as applicable, the moving party shall submit evidence of the suitability and creditworthiness of the proposed fiduciary.

(3) If the motion for temporary relief is not granted, the action will remain on the court docket for a final hearing.

(4) If the motion for temporary relief is granted, the court shall enter a date and time for the temporary hearing on the notice of hearing.

(5) The moving party shall serve pleadings on the alleged incapacitated individual, ward or protected person, and other adverse parties. Service must be made no later than ten days prior to the temporary hearing or as the court determines is reasonable for good cause shown.

(6) Temporary orders resulting from the hearing shall expire six months from the date of issuance unless otherwise specified in the order.

(C) In an emergency, the court may exercise the power of a guardian with or without notice if the court makes emergency findings as required by the Adult Health Care Consent Act, Section 44-66-30.

(D) After preliminary hearing upon such notice as the court deems reasonable, and if the petition requests temporary relief, the court has the power to preserve and apply the property of the alleged incapacitated individual as may be required for his benefit or the benefit of his dependents. Notice of the court's actions shall be given to interested parties as soon thereafter as possible.

(E) A hearing concerning the need for appointment of a permanent guardian must be a hearing de novo as to all issues before the court.

Part 3

Guardians of Incapacitated Individuals

SECTION 62-5-301. Testamentary nomination of guardian for incapacitated individual.

(A) The parent of an alleged incapacitated individual may by will nominate a guardian for an alleged incapacitated individual. A testamentary nomination by a parent gives the nominee priority pursuant to Section 62-5-308 in any proceeding to determine incapacity and appoint a guardian. A testamentary nomination by a parent gives priority to the nominee to make health care decisions for the alleged incapacitated individual pursuant to Section 44-66-30. Such nomination creates priority under Sections 62-5-308 and 44-66-30 when the will is informally or formally probated, if prior to the will being probated, both parents are deceased or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are deceased, the nomination by the parent who died later has priority unless it is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.

(B) The spouse of an alleged incapacitated individual may by will nominate a guardian for an alleged incapacitated individual. A testamentary nomination by a spouse gives the nominee priority pursuant to Section 62-5-308 in any proceeding to determine incapacity and appoint a guardian. A testamentary nomination by a spouse gives priority to the nominee to make health care decisions for the alleged incapacitated individual pursuant to Section 44-66-30. Such nomination creates priority under Sections 62-5-308 and 44-66-30 when the will is informally or formally probated. An effective nomination by a spouse has priority over a nomination by a parent unless the nomination is terminated by the denial of probate in formal proceedings.

(C) This State shall recognize a testamentary nomination under a will probated at the testator's domicile in another state.

(6) reasons why a guardianship is necessary, including why less restrictive alternatives are not available or appropriate, and a brief description of the nature and extent of the alleged incapacity;

(A) Upon receipt by the court of proof of service of the summons, petition, and notice of right to counsel upon the alleged incapacitated individual, the court shall:

(1) upon the expiration of fifteen days from filing the proof of service on the alleged incapacitated individual, if no notice of appearance has been filed by counsel retained by the alleged incapacitated individual, appoint counsel;

Unless the guardian ad litem or the alleged incapacitated individual objects, if a physician's notarized report is filed with the petition and served upon the alleged incapacitated individual and all interested parties with the petition, then the court may appoint such physician as the examiner. Upon the court's own motion or upon request of the initial examiner, the alleged incapacitated individual, or his guardian ad litem, the court may appoint a second examiner, who must be a physician, nurse, social worker, or psychologist.

(B) At any time during the proceeding, if requested by a guardian ad litem who is not an attorney, the court may appoint counsel for the guardian ad litem.

(C) At the attorney's discretion, the attorney for the alleged incapacitated individual may file a motion requesting that the court relieve him as the attorney if the alleged incapacitated individual is incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences regarding the appointment of a guardian. The attorney must file an affidavit in support of the motion. If the court is satisfied that the alleged incapacitated individual is incapable of communicating, with or without reasonable accommodations, his wishes, interests, or preferences regarding the appointment of a guardian, then the court may relieve the attorney from his duties as attorney for the alleged incapacitated individual. If the former attorney requests to be appointed as the guardian ad litem, the court may appoint him to serve as the guardian ad litem. An attorney cannot serve as both an attorney and as a guardian ad litem in a guardianship action.

SECTION 62-5-303C. Procedure for court appointment of a guardian; hearing.

The alleged incapacitated individual, all parties, and any person who has filed a demand for notice, shall be given notice of the hearing. The alleged incapacitated individual is entitled to be present at the hearing, to conduct discovery, and to review all evidence bearing upon his condition. The hearing may be closed at the request of the alleged incapacitated individual or his guardian ad litem. The alleged incapacitated individual may waive notice of a hearing and his presence at the hearing. If there is an agreement among all the parties and the guardian ad litem's report indicates that a hearing would not further the interests of justice, the alleged incapacitated individual may waive his right to a hearing. If the alleged incapacitated individual waives his right to a hearing, the court may:

(1) require a formal hearing;

(2) require an informal proceeding as the court shall direct; or

(3) proceed without a hearing.

(3) dismiss the proceeding.

Unless the guardian ad litem or the alleged incapacitated individual objects, if a physician's notarized report is filed with the petition and served upon the alleged incapacitated individual and all interested parties with the petition, then the court may appoint that physician as the examiner. Upon the court's own motion or upon request of the initial examiner, the alleged incapacitated individual, or his guardian ad litem, the court may appoint a second examiner, who must be a physician, nurse, social worker, or psychologist. No appointment of examiners is required when the basis for the petition is that the individual is confined, detained, or missing.

(B) At any time during the proceeding, if requested by a guardian ad litem who is not an attorney, the court may appoint counsel for the guardian ad litem.

The alleged incapacitated individual is entitled to be present at the hearing, to conduct discovery, and to review all evidence bearing upon his condition. The hearing may be closed at the request of the alleged incapacitated individual or his guardian ad litem. The alleged incapacitated individual may waive notice of a hearing and his presence at the hearing. If there is an agreement among all the parties and the guardian ad litem's report indicates that a hearing would not further the interests of justice, the alleged incapacitated individual may waive his right to a hearing.

(A) Each examiner shall complete a notarized report setting forth an evaluation of the condition of the alleged incapacitated individual. The original report must be filed with the court by the court's deadline, but not less than forty-eight hours prior to any hearing in which the report will be introduced as evidence. For good cause, the court may admit an examiner's report filed less than forty-eight hours prior to the hearing. All parties are entitled to review the reports, which are admissible as evidence. The evaluation shall contain, to the best of the examiner's knowledge and belief:

(B) Upon finding by clear and convincing evidence that a basis for an appointment or protective order exists for reasons other than minority, the court has the powers over the incapacitated individual's real and personal property and financial affairs which the incapacitated individual could exercise if not under disability, except the power to make a will or amend a revocable trust.

(6) protected person's gifting and estate plan; and

(7) protected person's life expectancy and the probable duration of incapacity.

(C) Prior to issuing a protective order, the court shall consider whether appointment of a conservator is necessary.

For purposes of issuing a consent order, counsel may consent on behalf of the protected person.

(D) The petitioner shall serve all heirs and devisees of the incapacitated individual whose identity and whereabouts are reasonably ascertainable with the petition seeking a protective order to perform one or more actions set forth in subsection (A)(2).

(2) make, modify, or terminate contracts; or

(10) any other person deemed suitable by the court.

(B) A person whose priority is based upon his status under subsections (A)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) may nominate in writing a person to serve in his or her stead. With respect to persons having equal priority, the court shall select the person it considers best qualified to serve as conservator.

When bond is required, the conservator shall file a statement under oath with the court indicating his best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the protected person and of the income expected from the personal estate during the next calendar year, and he shall execute and file a bond with the court, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate. The court shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property, or other adequate security. The court may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with a domestic financial institution, as defined in Section 62-6-101, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. The court may authorize an unrestricted account to be used by the conservator for expenses on behalf of the protected person, and all activity in such an account must be reported by the conservator as required by the court.

(3) After service of a summons and petition by a successor conservator, or upon the court's own motion, a proceeding may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the conservator.

(4) Subject to applicable statutes of limitation, the bond of the conservator is not void after the first recovery, but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.

SECTION 62-5-420. Persons dealing with conservators; protection.

A person, who in good faith either assists a conservator or deals with him for value in any transaction, other than those requiring a court order as required in this part is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the power. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power or the propriety of its exercise, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in Section 62-5-404 or Section 62-5-428 are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator. This protection extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. This protection is not a substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

(1) invest and reinvest funds of the estate as would a trustee;

SECTION 62-5-431. Payment of benefits from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to a minor or an incapacitated person; definitions.

(A) For purposes of this section:

(1) "Estate" and "income" include only monies received from the VA, all real and personal property acquired in whole or in part with these monies, and all earnings, interest, and profits.

(2) "Benefits" means all monies payable by the United States through the VA.

(3) "Secretary" means the Secretary of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or his successor.

(4) "Protected person" means a beneficiary of the VA.

(5) "Conservator" has the same meaning as provided in Section 62-1-201 but only as to benefits from the VA.

(B) Whenever, pursuant to a law of the United States or regulation of the VA, the Secretary requires that a conservator be appointed for a protected person before payment of benefits, the appointment must be made in the manner provided in this part, except to the extent this section requires otherwise. The petition shall show that the person to be protected has been rated incapable of handling his estate and monies on examination by the VA in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the VA.

(C) When a petition is filed for the appointment of a conservator and a certificate of the secretary or his representative is filed setting forth the fact that the appointment of a conservator is a condition precedent to the payment of benefits due the protected person by the VA, the certificate is prima facie evidence of the necessity for the appointment and no examiner's report is required.

(D) Except as provided or as otherwise permitted by the VA, a person may not serve as conservator of a protected person if the proposed conservator at that time is acting simultaneously as conservator for five protected persons. Upon presentation of a petition by an attorney for the VA alleging that a person is serving simultaneously as a conservator for more than five protected persons and requesting that person's termination as a conservator for that reason, upon proof substantiating the petition, the court shall restrain that person from acting as a conservator for the affected protected person and shall require a final accounting from the conservator. After the appointment of a successor conservator if one is warranted under the circumstances, the court shall terminate the appointment of the person as conservator in all requested cases. The limitations of this section do not apply when the conservator is a bank or trust company.

(E) The conservator shall file an inventory, accountings, exhibits or other pleadings with the court and with the VA as provided by law or VA regulation. The conservator is required to furnish the inventory and accountings to the VA.

(F) Every conservator shall invest the surplus funds in his protected person's estate in securities, or otherwise, as allowed by law, and in which the conservator has no interest. These funds may be invested, without prior court authorization, in direct interest-bearing obligations of this State or of the United States and in obligations in which the interest and principal are both unconditionally guaranteed by the United States Government.

(G) Whenever a copy of a public record is required by the VA to be used in determining the eligibility of a person to participate in benefits made available by the VA, the official charged with the custody of the public record shall provide a certified copy of the record, without charge, to an applicant for the benefits, a person acting on his behalf, or a representative of the VA.

(H) With regard to a minor or a mentally incompetent person to whom, or on whose behalf, benefits have been paid or are payable by the VA, the secretary is and must be a necessary party in a:

(1) proceeding brought for the appointment, confirmation, recognition, or removal of a conservator;

(2) suit or other proceeding, whether formal or informal, arising out of the administration of the person's estate; and

(3) proceeding which is for the removal of the disability of minority or of mental incompetency of the person.

(I) In a case or proceeding involving property or funds of a protected person not derived from the VA, the VA is not a necessary party, but may be an interested party in the proceedings.

(J) For services as conservator of funds paid from the VA, a conservator may be paid an amount not to exceed five percent of the income of the protected person during any year. If extraordinary services are rendered by a conservator, the court may, upon application of the conservator and notice to the VA, authorize additional compensation payable from the estate of the protected person. No compensation is allowed on the corpus of an estate derived from payments from the VA. The conservator may be allowed reimbursement from the estate of the protected person for reasonable premiums paid to a corporate surety upon the bond furnished by the conservator.

(1) The petitioner must file with the court a verified petition setting forth all of the pertinent facts concerning the claim, payment, attorney's fees, and expenses, if any, and the reasons why, in the opinion of the petitioner, the proposed settlement should be approved. For all claims that exceed twenty-five thousand dollars, the verified petition must include a statement by the petitioner that, in his opinion, the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the minor or incapacitated individual.

(2) If, upon consideration of the petition and after hearing the testimony as it may require concerning the matter, the court concludes that the proposed settlement is proper and in the best interests of the minor or incapacitated individual, the court shall issue its order approving the settlement and authorizing the petitioner to consummate it and, if the settlement requires the payment of money or the delivery of personal property for the benefit of the minor or incapacitated individual, to receive the money or personal property and execute a proper receipt and release or covenant not to sue therefor, which is binding upon the minor or incapacitated individual.

The payment or delivery of money or personal property to or for a minor or incapacitated individual must be made in accordance with Section 62-5-103. If a party subject to the court order fails or refuses to pay the money or deliver the personal property, as required by the order and in accordance with Section 62-5-103, he is liable and punishable as for contempt of court, but failure or refusal does not affect the validity or conclusiveness of the settlement.

If the certifying physician states that the principal's mental incompetence precludes the principal from making all health care decisions or all decisions concerning certain categories of health care, and that the principal's mental incompetence is permanent or of extended duration, no further certification is necessary in regard to the stated categories of health care decisions during the stated duration of mental incompetence unless the agent or the attending physician believes the principal may have regained capacity.
