At any time after the expiration of sixty days from the death of a nonresident decedent, any person indebted to the estate of the nonresident decedent or having possession or control of personal property, or of an instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action belonging to the estate of the nonresident decedent may pay the debt, deliver the personal property, or the instrument evidencing the debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action, to the domiciliary foreign personal representative of the nonresident decedent upon being presented with proof of his appointment and an affidavit made by or on behalf of the representative stating:

(1) the date of the death of the nonresident decedent;

(2) that no local administration, or application or petition therefor, is pending in this State;

(3) that the domiciliary foreign personal representative is entitled to payment or delivery.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-202. Payment or delivery discharges.

Payment or delivery made in good faith on the basis of the proof of authority and affidavit releases the debtor or person having possession of the personal property or of the instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action to the same extent as if payment or delivery had been made to a local personal representative.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 63; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-203. Resident creditor notice.

Payment or delivery under Section 62-4-201 may not be made if a resident creditor of the nonresident decedent has given written notice to the debtor of the nonresident decedent or the person having possession of the personal property or of the instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock, or chose in action belonging to the nonresident decedent that the debt should not be paid nor the property delivered to the domiciliary foreign personal representative.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1987 Act No. 171, Section 64; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-204. Proof of authority; bond.

If no local administration or application or petition therefor is pending in this State, a domiciliary foreign personal representative may file with a court in this State in a county in which property belonging to the decedent is located, authenticated copies of his appointment and of the will, if any. The filing of a bond shall not be required unless the court in its discretion orders it.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

Effect of Amendment

The 2013 amendment substituted "appointment and of the will, if any" for ", the will, if any, and of any official bond he has given, which bond shall name the court in this State as co-obligee on such bond", and added the second sentence, relating to filing of bond.

SECTION 62-4-205. Powers.

A domiciliary foreign personal representative who has complied with Section 62-4-204 may exercise as to assets (including real and personal property) in this State all powers of a local personal representative and may maintain actions and proceedings in this State subject to any conditions imposed upon nonresident parties generally.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 1990 Act No. 521, Section 80; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-206. Power of representatives in transition.

The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under Section 62-4-201 or 62-4-205 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this State. An application or petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under Section 62-4-205, but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed his position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for him in any action or proceedings in this State.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-207. Ancillary and other local administrations; governing provision.

In respect to a nonresident decedent, the provisions of Article 3 [Sections 62-3-101 et seq.] govern (1) proceedings, if any, in a court of this State for probate of the will, appointment, removal, supervision, and discharge of the local personal representative, and any other order concerning the estate; and (2) the status, powers, duties, and liabilities of any local personal representative and the rights of claimants, purchasers, distributees, and others in regard to a local administration. The initiation of a proceeding under Article 3 (Sections 62-3-101 et seq.) is the appropriate procedure for an ancillary administration relating to the real property of a nonresident decedent located in this State and is an alternative to the procedures available to a foreign personal representative under Sections 62-4-201 through 62-4-206.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2000 Act No. 398, Section 9; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

Effect of Amendment

The 2013 amendment inserted at the end "and is an alternative to the procedures available to a foreign personal representative under Sections 62-4-201 through 62-4-206".

Part 3

Jurisdiction Over Foreign Personal Representatives

SECTION 62-4-301. Jurisdiction by act of foreign personal representative.

A foreign personal representative submits personally to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State in any proceeding relating to the estate by (1) filing authenticated copies of his appointment as provided in Section 62-4-204, (2) receiving payment of money or taking delivery of personal property under Section 62-4-201, or (3) doing any act as a personal representative in this State which would have given the State jurisdiction over him as an individual. Jurisdiction under (2) is limited to the money or value of personal property collected.

HISTORY: 1986 Act No. 539, Section 1; 2013 Act No. 100, Section 1, eff January 1, 2014.

SECTION 62-4-302. Jurisdiction by act of decedent.

SECTION 62-4-303. Service on foreign personal representative.

(a) Service of process may be made upon the foreign personal representative by registered or certified mail, addressed to his last reasonably ascertainable address, requesting a return receipt signed by addressee only. Notice by ordinary first class mail is sufficient if registered or certified mail service to the addressee is unavailable. Service may be made upon a foreign personal representative in the manner in which service could have been made under other laws of this State on either the foreign personal representative or his decedent immediately prior to death.

(b) If service is made upon a foreign personal representative as provided in subsection (a), he shall be allowed thirty days within which to appear or respond.

Part 4

Judgments and Personal Representatives

SECTION 62-4-401. Effect of adjudication for or against personal representative.
